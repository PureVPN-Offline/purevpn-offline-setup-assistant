## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1.  **Confirm the vulnerability:** We will try to reproduce the vulnerability and confirm its impact.
2.  **Code audit:** We will audit the codebase to find any similar problems.
3.  **Prepare a fix:** We will prepare a patch for the vulnerability.
4.  **Release the fix:** We will release a new version of the project that includes the fix.

We will not disclose the vulnerability until a fix is in place. We will credit the person who reported the vulnerability in the release notes, unless they wish to remain anonymous.

We are committed to addressing all security issues in a timely manner. Thank you for helping to keep this project secure.
